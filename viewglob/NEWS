New in 1.0.3, released 2005-03-06:
	Features:
	  * Added shortcut to refocus the display and terminal for when they
	    get separated.
	  * Map $HOME to ~ in the display (the /home/blah part)

New in 1.0.2, released 2004-11-19:
	Features:
	  * Added option to increase/decrease base font size in the display.

	Bug fixes:
	  * BSD: Ctrl-C will now work in a viewglob shell.  Thanks to Ron
	    Ross.
	  * Replaced pseudo terminal code with some stuff from rxvt, which
	    should go a long way towards improving compatibility.
	  * Fixed an infinite forking bug which could take down a machine.

New in 1.0.1, released 2004-10-12:
	Features:
	  * Added options to display directories in reverse order or
	    reverse order with the current directory first.  Idea
	    contributed by Artis Rozentals.

New in 1.0, released 2004-09-28:
	Features:
	  * Added functionality to insert file/directory name/path into
	    terminal upon double click and shift-double click.
	  * Added "smart-insert" functionality and program flag.
	  * Keystrokes typed into the display are written to the terminal.
	  * Display titlebar shows the path of the current directory.

	Bug fixes:
	  * Long-standing display resize issue fixed (window no longer
	    sometimes enforces a ridiculous minimum width).
	  * No more zombie process when the display is toggled off.
	  * No more lingering fifos after quitting the program.
	  * viewglob will no longer deadlock if used extensively for a long
	    period of time.
	  * BSD: viewglob no longer crashes when toggling the display.
	  * BSD: (long-standing issue): both shells are now terminated
	    correctly upon program exit.

New in 0.9.1, released 2004-09-20:
	* The display can now be toggled on and off from the terminal (and
	  from the display).  Idea contributed by Andy Bastien.
	* viewglob can be disabled from the terminal (leaving shell intact).
	* Fixed some command line tracking issues introduced in 0.9.
	* Fixed the "Show Hidden" context menu functionality.
	* Fixed a display resizing bug.
	* Fixed formatting in documentation.
	* Conformance to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.
	* Miscellaneous bug fixes.

New in 0.9, released 2004-09-09:
	* Added support for zsh (please send bug reports!).
	* Added functionality to navigate the display from the terminal.
	* Changed the appearance of restriced directories in the display.
	* Fixed bug involving transcript naming.
	* Fixed bug involving directories with special characters.
	* Removed "name" mode directory comparison (there's no good reason to
	  use it).
	* Disallowed executing viewglob from a viewglob-controlled shell.
	* Fixed several build issues.
	* Other small bugs fixed.
	* Large code reorganization.

New in 0.8.4, released 2004-08-31:
	* Fixed a big bug where the file boxes in the display would misbehave
	  in many themes.
	* Slight improvement to memory usage.

New in 0.8.3, released 2004-08-26:
	* The contents of a directory are listed upon typing/tab-completing
	  its trailing slash, rather than just upon referencing a file in the
	  directory.  This is more intuitive and makes viewglob immediately
	  more useful (you need to try it to see the difference).  Idea
	  contributed by Pavel Tavoda.
	* Decreased the time required to refresh a directory listing.  It is
	  now almost an order of magnitude faster in a worst-case scenario
	  (thousands of files, all selected).
	* No more calls to init-viewglob.sh on startup, which would clutter up
	  the user's .bash_history and sometimes cause a beep.
	* Fixed an annoying bug where viewglob would confuse the output of a
	  multi-hit tab-completion with the command line.

New in 0.8.2, released 2004-08-23:
	* Added recognition functionality for all basic Unix file types (and
	  executable regular files).
	* File icons will now scale to the font size.
	* Selected files are always shown, even if the display limit is
	  exceeded or if they are hidden files.
	* Errors in config file parsing will be reported.
	* Made slight changes to the display layout.
	* Fixed double-slash bug when directories at / referenced.
	* Increased the default file display limit to 500.
	* Fixed many build warnings.
	* Many small bugs fixed.
	* Code reorganization.

New in 0.8.1, released 2004-08-11:
	* The display will no longer confuse command-line data with glob data
	  if you type really fast.
	* Command line text box in the display will no longer grow the window.
	* File layout of directories in the display is now easier on the eyes.
	* Fixed small command line processing error.
	* Forced exit now a little more graceful.

New in 0.8.0, released 2004-08-08:
	* Initial release.
