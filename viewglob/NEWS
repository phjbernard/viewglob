New in 0.8.4, released 2004-08-31:
	* Fixed a big bug where the file boxes in the display would misbehave in
	  many themes.
	* Slight improvement to memory usage.

New in 0.8.3, released 2004-08-26:
	* The contents of a directory are listed upon typing/tab-completing its
	  trailing slash, rather than just upon referencing a file in the directory.
	  This is more intuitive and makes viewglob immediately more useful (you
	  need to try it to see the difference).  Idea contributed by Pavel Tavoda.
	* Decreased the time required to refresh a directory listing.  It is now
	  almost an order of magnitude faster in a worst-case scenario (thousands
	  of files, all selected).
	* No more calls to init-viewglob.sh on startup, which would clutter up the
	  user's .bash_history and sometimes cause a beep.
	* Fixed an annoying bug where viewglob would confuse the output of a multi-
	  hit tab-completion with the command line.

New in 0.8.2, released 2004-08-23:
	* Added recognition functionality for all basic Unix file types (and
	  executable regular files).
	* File icons will now scale to the font size.
	* Selected files are always shown, even if the display limit is exceeded
	  or if they are hidden files.
	* Errors in config file parsing will be reported.
	* Made slight changes to the display layout.
	* Fixed double-slash bug when directories at / referenced.
	* Increased the default file display limit to 500.
	* Fixed many build warnings.
	* Many small bugs fixed.
	* Code reorganization.

New in 0.8.1, released 2004-08-11:
	* The display will no longer confuse command-line data with glob data if
	  you type really fast.
	* Command-line text box in the display will no longer grow the window.
	* File layout of directories in the display is now easier on the eyes.
	* Fixed small command-line processing error.
	* Forced exit now a little more graceful.

New in 0.8.0, released 2004-08-08:
	* Initial release.
