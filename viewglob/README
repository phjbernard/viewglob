INTRODUCTION
------------

viewglob  is  a  utility designed to complement the Unix shell in graphical
environments. It has two parts:

     1.   A tool that sits as a layer between the  shell  and  X  terminal,
          keeping track of the user's current directory and command line.

     2.   A graphical display which shows the layouts of directories refer­
          enced on the command line (including pwd).

The display also shows the results of file globs and expansions as they are
typed (hence the name), highlighting selected files and potential name com­
pletions.

The website is here:

The sourceforge listing is here:

New releases are announced through Freshmeat, so if you'd like to stay  up-

NEW IN THIS RELEASE
-------------------

First  of all, if you've got a previous installation of viewglob that's not
from a package manager (i.e. you just ran make && make install), you should
remove it before installing this version. I was incorrectly installing some
binaries to .../share/viewglob  instead  of  .../lib/viewglob,  which  goes
against  the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. If you've still got the sources
to the old install, a make uninstall should do the job. If not, the  direc­
tory which you want to remove is, by default, /usr/local/share/viewglob.

The  display can now be toggled on and off with the sequence Ctrl-G <SPACE>
(or Ctrl-G Ctrl-<SPACE>). If the display is closed manually,  viewglob  now
interprets  it  as  toggling off, and doesn't disable itself. A toggled-off
display still follows the state of the shell (i.e.  when  it's  toggled  on
it'll be at the right place).

To  disable  viewglob  (which you used to be able to do by closing the dis­
play), you can use the sequence Ctrl-G Q (but not  Ctrl-G  Ctrl-Q,  because
that's  too  easy to type accidentally). Disabling a viewglob shell is non-
recoverable.

When you might want to toggle off the display (C-g <SPACE>):

     -  You're dealing with a directory or a  series  of  directories  that
        have  a lot of files, and the display's refresh time is slowing you
        down.

     -  You need the extra memory (the display's memory footprint is  some­
        times  not  as small as it probably should be); when the display is
        "toggled off", all of its memory is freed.

     -  It's just in the way.

When you might want to disable viewglob (C-g q):

     -  You just want a regular shell, but you want  to  keep  the  current
        environment.

     -  Maybe  you're  compiling in the background, and your viewglob shell
        has begun to stutter.

See NEWS for the full list of changes.

INSTALLATION
------------

See the file INSTALL for generic instructions.  This  program  follows  the
./configure && make && make install convention.

PORTABILITY
-----------

Tested on:

     FreeBSD 4.10 with GTK+ 2.4.3
     GNU/Linux (various) with GTK+ 2.4+
     Mac OS X 10.3.5 with fink unstable providing GTK+ 2.4.9 (viewglob 0.9)

I don't have access to Solaris, so I can only hope for the best -- it would
be awesome if someone could try it for me.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

viewglob requires a version of bash (any, as far as I know) and GTK+ 2.4. A
version  of  zsh  is  also  obviously required if you wish to use zsh under
viewglob.
