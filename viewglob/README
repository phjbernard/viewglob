INTRODUCTION
------------

viewglob  is  a  utility designed to complement the Unix shell in graphical
environments. It has two parts:

     1.   A tool that sits as a layer between the  shell  and  X  terminal,
          keeping track of the user's current directory and command line.

     2.   A graphical display which shows the layouts of directories refer­
          enced on the command line (including pwd).

The display reveals the results of file globs and expansions  as  they  are
typed (hence the name), highlighting selected files and potential name com­
pletions.

It can also be used as a surrogate terminal, where keystrokes typed in  the
display  are  passed  to  the  shell.  Files and directories can be double-
clicked to insert their names and/or paths into the terminal.

The website is here:

New releases are announced through Freshmeat, so if you'd like to stay  up-

NEW IN THIS RELEASE
-------------------

The  biggest  change  is the addition of file name insert functionality. If
you double click a file in the display (or the directory header), its  name
will  be  passed  as text to the terminal. Holding shift will send the full
path to the file.

By default viewglob is in "smart insert" mode. There's more info about that
in the man page.

This  release  also  allows  you  to  type  into  the  display and have the
keystrokes passed to the terminal. This works well in my testing,  but  let
me  know  if  you're  finding that the display doesn't pass something along
correctly. Note that navigation keys are captured by the display instead of
being passed on.

Two  large  issues  with FreeBSD (and assumedly the other BSDs as well) are
also fixed. I've been unable to track down the problem with Ctrl-C and SIG­
INT,  though;  if  you  are  a terminal I/O savvy BSD user willing to help,
please get in touch with me.

See NEWS for the full list of important changes.

INSTALLATION
------------

See the file INSTALL for generic instructions.  This  program  follows  the
./configure && make && make install convention.

PORTABILITY
-----------

Tested on:

     FreeBSD 4.10 with GTK+ 2.4.3
     GNU/Linux (various) with GTK+ 2.4+
     Mac OS X 10.3.5 with fink unstable providing GTK+ 2.4.9 (viewglob 0.9)

I don't have access to Solaris, so I can only hope for the best -- it would
be awesome if someone could try it for me.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

viewglob requires a version of bash (any, as far as I know) and GTK+ 2.4. A
version  of  zsh  is  also  obviously required if you wish to use zsh under
viewglob.
