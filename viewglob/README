INTRODUCTION
------------

viewglob  is  a  utility designed to complement the Unix shell in graphical
environments. It has two parts:

     1.   A tool that sits as a layer between the  shell  and  X  terminal,
          keeping track of the user's current directory and command-line.

     2.   A graphical display which shows the layouts of directories refer­
          enced on the command-line (including pwd).

The display also shows the results of file globs and expansions as they are
typed (hence the name), highlighting selected files and potential name com­
pletions.

This is the second release. See NEWS and ChangeLog  for  more  information.
See the manpage (man viewglob) for notes and usage information.

Feedback is welcome!

INSTALLATION
------------

See  the  file  INSTALL  for generic instructions. This program follows the
./configure && make && make install convention.

PORTABILITY
-----------

It runs for sure on FreeBSD 4.10 and GNU/Linux 2.6. I don't have access  to
OS  X or Solaris, so I can only hope for the best -- it would be awesome if
someone could try it for me.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

viewglob requires a version of bash, and at least GTK+ 2.4 (I'll see  if  I
can relax that requirement in the next release).
