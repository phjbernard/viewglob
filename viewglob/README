INTRODUCTION
------------

viewglob  is  a  utility designed to complement the Unix shell in graphical
environments. It has two parts:

     1.   A tool that sits as a layer between the  shell  and  X  terminal,
          keeping track of the user's current directory and command-line.

     2.   A graphical display which shows the layouts of directories refer­
          enced on the command-line (including pwd).

The display also shows the results of file globs and expansions as they are
typed (hence the name), highlighting selected files and potential name com­
pletions.

This is the third release. See NEWS and ChangeLog for more information. See
the manpage (man viewglob) for notes and usage information.

Feedback is welcome!

INSTALLATION
------------

See  the  file  INSTALL  for generic instructions. This program follows the
./configure && make && make install convention.

PORTABILITY
-----------

Tested on FreeBSD 4.10 and various GNU/Linux distributions.  I  don't  have
access  to  OS X or Solaris, so I can only hope for the best -- it would be
awesome if someone could try it for me.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

viewglob requires a version of bash (any, as far as I know) and GTK+ 2.4.
