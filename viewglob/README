INTRODUCTION
------------

Viewglob  is  a filesystem visualization add-on for Bash and Zsh. It tracks
the command line and environment of any number of interactive shells (local
and  remote).  A  graphical  display follows the currently active terminal,
listing the contents of directories relevant to its shell and  highlighting
file selections and potential name completions dynamically.

The package has three communicating parts:

     - vgseer, client:
          Supervises  an  interactive shell and keeps track of command line
          and environment changes.

     - vgd, server daemon:
          Mediates information exchange between any number of  vgseer  pro-
          cesses (local or remote) and a Viewglob display.

     - vgmini and vgclassic, graphical displays:
          List the contents of directories relevant to the currently active
          shell, highlighting file selections and  potential  name  comple-
          tions.

A convenience script "viewglob" is provided as a startup shortcut.

You  can  learn  more  about  using  this package in the manpages for view-
glob(1), vgseer(1), and vgd(1).

NEW IN THIS RELEASE
-------------------

Mostly just fixing OS X compatibility. See NEWS for more information.


INSTALLATION
------------

For a full install, it's a simple ./configure && make && sudo make install.
If  you  only  wish  to  install the shell client portion, say for a server
without X or GTK+ which you only access  through  ssh,  use  the  following
flag:

      ./configure --enable-vgseer-only

See the file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

All  installations  of Viewglob require a version of Bash (any, as far as I
know). A client-only install requires GLib 2.2, and a full install requires
GTK+  2.4.  A  version of Zsh is also obviously required if you wish to use
Zsh under Viewglob.


PORTABILITY
-----------

Tested on:

     FreeBSD 4.10 with GTK+ 2.4.3
     GNU/Linux (various) with GTK+ 2.4+

This version of Viewglob is also said to run on Mac OS X 10.3.9 (with  fink
providing GTK+ 2.4).

The  program has been built with portability in mind, so it should (ha) run
on most POSIX-compliant systems with minimal fuss. I happily accept patches
for portability issues.
