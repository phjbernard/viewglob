INTRODUCTION
------------

viewglob  is  a  utility designed to complement the Unix shell in graphical
environments. It has two parts:

     1.   A tool that sits as a layer between the  shell  and  X  terminal,
          keeping track of the user's current directory and command line.

     2.   A graphical display which shows the layouts of directories refer­
          enced on the command line (including pwd).

The display also shows the results of file globs and expansions as they are
typed (hence the name), highlighting selected files and potential name com­
pletions.

The website is here:

NEW IN THIS RELEASE
-------------------

Preliminary  support for zsh has been added. From my testing viewglob works
well with the advanced completion features of zsh, but there is  a  lot  of
ground  to  cover. If you use zsh and find that viewglob isn't working well
at all, please let me know - I'd be mostly interested in seeing your .zshrc
file.

This release also adds the capability to navigate the display from the ter­
minal. This is done in a way similar to GNU screen's Ctrl-A commands -  you
type the control key followed by a direction character.

I've  chosen  Ctrl-G as viewglob's control key, because a. the letter makes
sense, and b. Ctrl-G is by default just a beeping (i.e. more annoying) ver­
sion  of  Ctrl-C in most shell configurations, and I don't think people use
it. But I could be wrong.

If you think this is a bad move, let me know. Making the control  key  con­
figurable would complicate things, but I'd be willing to go the distance if
there's a reason to do so.

I've tried to accomodate both emacs and vi users for key bindings:

     Down:       j, n, <Down Arrow>

     Up:         k, p, <Up Arrow>

     Page Down:  f, d, <PgDown>

     Page Up:    b, u, <PgUp>

The Ctrl counterparts also work. Read NEWS and ChangeLog for more  informa­
tion. See the manpage (man viewglob) for notes and usage information.

INSTALLATION
------------

See  the  file  INSTALL  for generic instructions. This program follows the
./configure && make && make install convention.

PORTABILITY
-----------

Tested on:

     FreeBSD 4.10 with GTK+ 2.4.3
     GNU/Linux (various) with GTK+ 2.4+
     Mac OS X 10.3.5 with fink unstable providing GTK+ 2.4.9

I don't have access to Solaris, so I can only hope for the best -- it would
be awesome if someone could try it for me.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

viewglob requires a version of bash (any, as far as I know) and GTK+ 2.4. A
version of zsh is also obviously required if you  wish  to  use  zsh  under
viewglob.
