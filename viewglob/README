INTRODUCTION
------------

Viewglob is a filesystem visualization add-on for Bash and Zsh when used in
windowing environments. It controls a graphical display  listing  the  con­
tents  of  certain directories, with file selections, which are relevant to
the active shell+terminal. The display updates dynamically when the command
line  or environment of the current shell changes or when the user switches
to a different terminal. It can track multiple shells, local and remote.

The package has three communicating parts:

     - vgseer, client:
          Supervises an interactive shell and keeps track of  command  line
          and environment changes.

     - vgd, server daemon:
          Mediates  information  exchange between any number of vgseer pro­
          cesses (local or remote) and a Viewglob display.

     - vgmini and vgclassic, graphical displays:
          List the contents of directories relevant to the currently active
          shell,  highlighting  file  selections and potential name comple­
          tions.

A convenience script "viewglob" is provided as a startup shortcut.

You can learn more about using this  package  in  the  manpages  for  view­
glob(1), vgseer(1), and vgd(1).

NEW IN THIS RELEASE
-------------------

Lots  of  work  has been done to implement some of the most often requested
features, resulting in a massive code  overhall  and  completely  different
"under the hood" execution. It's a large enough release that even if you've
used Viewglob before, you'll probably have to glance through the manpages.

Here's a short list of the biggest changes:

     - Multiple terminal tracking for a single display
     - Viewglob tracking for remote shells (ssh, telnet)
     - A new display program (used by default)
     - Filename masking as a means to filter display results

INSTALLATION
------------

For a full install, it's a simple ./configure && make && sudo make install.
If  you  only  wish  to  install the shell client portion, say for a server
without X or GTK+ which you only access  through  ssh,  use  the  following
flag:

      ./configure --enable-vgseer-only

See the file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.

PORTABILITY
-----------

Tested on:

     FreeBSD 4.10 with GTK+ 2.4.3
     GNU/Linux (various) with GTK+ 2.4+

Previous  versions  of  Viewglob  were said to run on Mac OS X 10.3.5 (with
fink unstable providing GTK+ 2.4), but it has  not  been  tested  for  this
release.

The  program has been built with portability in mind, so it should (ha) run
on most POSIX-compliant systems with minimal fuss. I happily accept patches
for portability issues.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Viewglob requires a version of Bash (any, as far as I know) and GTK+ 2.4. A
version of Zsh is also obviously required if you  wish  to  use  Zsh  under
Viewglob.
