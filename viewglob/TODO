- Sockets
- Have glob shell output into socket into seer, and filter output and only transmit changes to gui?
- record timestamp for each byte to help predicting whether user typing or not (problem if pasting text though)
- Get buffered text from that extra fifo so it can be spat onto command line when viewglob initiates (text typed while viewglob is being executed, not yet presenting command line) instead of throwing it away?
- dlisting of current directory in display different colour?
- Use a different key sequence than Ctrl-G (easier to type)?

- Instead of:
	# Source the user's run-control file.
	[ -f ~/.zshrc ] && . ~/.zshrc
   Have vgseer (or whatever) change ZDOTDIR to VG_ZDOTDIR (and then set ZDOTDIR), and then use $VG_ZDOTDIR/.zshrc instead of ~/.zshrc

seer:
	- screen compatibility
	- integration with bash-completion, if viable
	- test and fix command-line parsing for wrapped lines.
		- periodically run a ^M cleaning function?
	- Keep track of variable changes by running env in PROMPT_COMMAND?

gviewglob:
	- multiple column option (--columns=# ) ?
	- Change /home/blah to ~/ in titlebar only
	- if knowingly out of sync, send message to display to put up X icon and say "(viewglob will catch up on the next command)"
	- slight highlighting difference between files named explicitly and files expanded from a glob?
	- don't focus on gtk window when opened (is this viable?)
	- wait/lost indicators?
	- Truncate directory path label if it's too big.
		- like this: "/path/to/dir/blah/" --> "/path/to/d..."
		- same for single-column file lists (maybe split in the middle?)
	- convert "2 selected, 10 total (4 hidden)" to "2, 10 (4)" if window size is too small
		- then use "2, 10..." if it's really really small?
	- Improve wrapbox resizing

Future:
	- vgterm -- terminal based on rxvt (unicode?) with integrated gviewglob display.
	- many terminals linking to the same display, with the display showing the info of the focused terminal only?
