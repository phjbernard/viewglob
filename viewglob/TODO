Critical:
- vgseer: sandbox vgexpand command options
- vgclassic: mask and developing mask
- make: option to build only vgseer/vgexpand (and thus no GTK requirement)
- make: package getopt_long (or alternative)
- documentation: updates from 1.1.1
- vgseer, vgdisplay: statuses
- vgdisplay: make icon disable work
- vgd: remap g_log: syslog
- vgseer: remap g_log
- vgseer: close stderr in user shell
- vgdisplays: --red --green --blue, etc.
- vgmini: scroll to active part of filebox
- vgmini: single click to activate dc
- vgmini: jumping, resizing to fit active terminal
- make: autoscan
- make: move pty_child_blah() into separate file which only vgseer uses

Non-critical:
- vgd: refocus activates the window which isn't activated instead of just
  bringing to front
- vgseer: sanitize mask better
- vgexpand: fix $HOME to ~
- vgseer: EIO when zsh exit
- make: .PHONY build for the icons
- vgd: vgseer_client into separate file
- vgseer: filename insertion is buggy at inserting within a word
- vgseer: rename Connection
- vgmini: filebox negotiation
- vgd/vgdisplay: sometimes not update on new pwd
- all: pedantic
- vgmini: white (base colour) background for fileboxes?

- record timestamp for each byte to help predicting whether user typing or not (problem if pasting text though)
- dlisting of current directory in display different colour?
- Use a different key sequence than Ctrl-G (easier to type)?
- In display command line, underline the character which has the cursor

seer:
	- screen compatibility
	- integration with bash-completion, if viable
	- test and fix command-line parsing for wrapped lines.
		- periodically run a ^M cleaning function?
	- Keep track of variable changes by running env in PROMPT_COMMAND?

gviewglob:
	- multiple column option (--columns=# ) ?
	- if knowingly out of sync, send message to display to put up X icon and say "(viewglob will catch up on the next command)"
	- slight highlighting difference between files named explicitly and files expanded from a glob?
	- don't focus on gtk window when opened (is this viable?)
	- wait/lost indicators?
	- Truncate directory path label if it's too big.
		- like this: "/path/to/dir/blah/" --> "/path/to/d..."
		- same for single-column file lists (maybe split in the middle?)
	- convert "2 selected, 10 total (4 hidden)" to "2, 10 (4)" if window size is too small
		- then use "2, 10..." if it's really really small?
	- Improve wrapbox resizing

Future:
	- vgterm -- terminal based on rxvt (unicode?) with integrated gviewglob display.
