Critical:
- doc: konsole and gnome-terminal
- make: viewglob.in should not be packaged?
- cygwin

End:
- vgseer: close stderr in user shell
- remove '[Exiting viewglob]'

Non-critical:
- vgclassic: mask and developing mask
- vgdisplays: shift click filename puts full path
- vgmini: statuses
- make: don't need sed
- use strchr instead of strstr
- vgd: refocus activates the window which isn't activated instead of just
  bringing to front
- vgseer: sanitize mask better
- vgexpand: fix $HOME to ~
- vgseer: EIO when zsh exit
- vgd: vgseer_client into separate file
- vgseer: filename insertion is buggy at inserting within a word
- vgseer: rename Connection
- vgmini: filebox negotiation
- vgd/vgdisplay: sometimes not update on new pwd
- all: pedantic
- vgmini: white (base colour) background for fileboxes?

- record timestamp for each byte to help predicting whether user typing or not (problem if pasting text though)
- dlisting of current directory in display different colour?
- Use a different key sequence than Ctrl-G (easier to type)?
- In display command line, underline the character which has the cursor

seer:
	- screen compatibility
	- integration with bash-completion, if viable
	- test and fix command-line parsing for wrapped lines.
		- periodically run a ^M cleaning function?
	- Keep track of variable changes by running env in PROMPT_COMMAND?

gviewglob:
	- multiple column option (--columns=# ) ?
	- if knowingly out of sync, send message to display to put up X icon and say "(viewglob will catch up on the next command)"
	- slight highlighting difference between files named explicitly and files expanded from a glob?
	- don't focus on gtk window when opened (is this viable?)
	- wait/lost indicators?
	- Truncate directory path label if it's too big.
		- like this: "/path/to/dir/blah/" --> "/path/to/d..."
		- same for single-column file lists (maybe split in the middle?)
	- convert "2 selected, 10 total (4 hidden)" to "2, 10 (4)" if window size is too small
		- then use "2, 10..." if it's really really small?
	- Improve wrapbox resizing

Future:
	- vgterm -- terminal based on rxvt (unicode?) with integrated gviewglob display.
