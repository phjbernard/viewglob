seer:
	- zsh functionality
	- screen compatibility
	- test and fix command-line parsing for wrapped lines.
		- periodically run a ^M cleaning function?
	- Keep track of variable changes by running env in PROMPT_COMMAND?

	Future:
	- many terminals linking to the same display, with the display showing the info of the focused terminal only?
	- commands from terminal to navigate display window.

gviewglob:
	- DIR_COLORS
	- fix scrollbar width assumption
	- slight highlighting difference between files named explicitly and files expanded from a glob?
	- don't focus on gtk window when opened (is this viable?)
	- wait indicator?
	- sometimes (but not always) the wrapboxes or DListing headers force a width minimum.
	- Truncate directory path label if it's too big.
		- like this: "/path/to/dir/blah/" --> "/path/to/d..."
	- convert "2 selected, 10 total (4 hidden)" to "2, 10 (4)" if window size is too small
		- then use "2, 10..." if it's really really small?
	- Wrapbox resizing works (barely), but is achieved in an ugly way.
