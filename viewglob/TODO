seer:
	- screen compatibility
	- integration with bash-completion, if viable
	- test and fix command-line parsing for wrapped lines.
		- periodically run a ^M cleaning function?
	- Keep track of variable changes by running env in PROMPT_COMMAND?

	Future:
	- many terminals linking to the same display, with the display showing the info of the focused terminal only?

glob-expand & seer:
	- reverse order flag (also PWD-first option?)

gviewglob:
	- multiple column option (--columns=# ) ?
	- if knowingly out of sync, send message to display to put up X icon and say "(viewglob will catch up on the next command)"
	- DIR_COLORS
	- slight highlighting difference between files named explicitly and files expanded from a glob?
	- don't focus on gtk window when opened (is this viable?)
	- wait/lost indicators?
	- Truncate directory path label if it's too big.
		- like this: "/path/to/dir/blah/" --> "/path/to/d..."
		- same for single-column file lists (maybe split in the middle?)
	- convert "2 selected, 10 total (4 hidden)" to "2, 10 (4)" if window size is too small
		- then use "2, 10..." if it's really really small?
	- Improve wrapbox resizing
